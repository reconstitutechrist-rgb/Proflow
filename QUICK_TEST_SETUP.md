# Quick Test Setup for Document Workshop

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Setup Required First

Your `node_modules` directory is missing. You need to install dependencies before testing.

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will take a few minutes. You should see:
```
added XXX packages in XXs
```

## Step 2: Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see output like:
```
VITE v6.1.x ready in XXX ms

‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
‚ûú  Network: use --host to expose
‚ûú  press h + enter to show help
```

## Step 3: Open Document Workshop

Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5173/DocumentWorkshop

(Or whatever URL vite shows in the terminal)

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Cannot find module 'vite'"
```bash
# Delete everything and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Error: Port 5173 already in use
```bash
# Kill existing process
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9

# Or use different port
npm run dev -- --port 5174
```

### Error: "React is not defined"
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Browser shows blank page
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Check Console tab for errors
3. Look for red error messages
4. Share those errors for help

## Alternative: Quick Code Check (No Server Needed)

If you can't run the server, I can still help you:

1. **Static Code Analysis**
   - Check for syntax errors
   - Verify imports
   - Validate structure

2. **Manual Review**
   - Review component logic
   - Check state management
   - Validate routing

Just let me know what you'd prefer!

## Next Steps After Testing

Once Phase 1 is confirmed working:

1. **Report any bugs** you find
2. **Take screenshots** of working features
3. **Decide** if we proceed to Phase 2 or fix issues
4. **Phase 2** will add the rich text editor + AI copilot
